# Predicting Birthweight of All Babies from Weight Gained by Parent Giving Birth

1. relationship between birthweight and Gained
```{r}
ggplot(data = ncb, aes(x = Gained, y = BirthWeightGm)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

2. linear model 
```{r}
model1 <- lm(ncb$BirthWeightGm~ncb$Gained)

summary(model1)

```

# diagnostic plot
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
